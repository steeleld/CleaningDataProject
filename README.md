## Project Description and Given Criteria

Project description below copied from the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Coursera course (Feb/Mar 2016). Minor edits made in formatting and structure. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Review criteria

1. The submitted data set is tidy.
2. The Github repo contains the required scripts.
3. GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
5. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 
1. a tidy data set as described below, 
2. a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
(extra) You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here are the data for the project:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# -----------------  SECTION STEP 1 ----------------------------

# STEP 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

# Setwd() for my computer:
setwd("C:/Users/LDS/Documents/rprograms/CleaningData/CourseProject/DataSets")

# Reading in the original column names for the raw data sets and sets the two 
        # new column names 
features <- read.table("features.txt", header = FALSE, 
                       col.names=c("rawNameNumber", "rawVariableName"))


# Reading in raw data from the original data files, setting column names as 
        # given in the "rawVariableName" above
X_test <- read.table("./test/X_test.txt", 
                     colClasses = "numeric", 
                     col.names=features$rawVariableName)
X_train <- read.table("./train/X_train.txt", 
                      colClasses = "numeric", 
                      col.names=features$rawVariableName)

# Reading in raw data from the original subject data files
X_test_subject <- read.table("./test/subject_test.txt", 
                             colClasses = "numeric", 
                             col.names="subject")
X_train_subject <- read.table("./train/subject_train.txt", 
                              colClasses = "numeric",
                              col.names="subject")

# Reading in raw data from the original activity label data files
y_test <- read.table("./test/y_test.txt", 
                     colClasses = "numeric",
                     col.names="activitynum")
y_train <- read.table("./train/y_train.txt", 
                      colClasses = "numeric",
                      col.names="activitynum")

# Reading in activity labels, then deleting column with redundant numbers
activities <- read.table("./activity_labels.txt",
                         colClasses = c("numeric", "character"),
                         col.names=c("activitynum","activity"))
y_test <- merge(y_test,activities) # merging sets with activity labels
y_train <- merge(y_train,activities) #...
y_test <- select(y_test, activity)
y_train <- select(y_train, activity)

# Column bind the information together
X_test_all <-cbind(X_test, X_test_subject, y_test)
X_train_all <-cbind(X_train, X_train_subject, y_train)

# merging the two data frames using the dplyr library functions and rbind 
X_total <- rbind(X_test_all, X_train_all) # row binding for one large (combined) data set
X_total <- tbl_df(X_total) # converting data frames for screen visual outputs


# -----------------  SECTION STEP 2 ----------------------------

# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
# measurement.

# Do a general search on columns that contain mean and std. Regular expression 
   # starts and ends with "." to search for columns like ".mean" and eliminate 
   # columns with meanFreq.  Escape \\ variable used so "." searched as character
meanCols <- X_total[,grepl("\\.[Mm]ean\\.", colnames(X_total))] # columns containing mean
stdCols <- X_total[,grepl("[Ss]td", colnames(X_total))] # columns containting std
subject <- X_total$subject
activity <- X_total$activity

# get subset of columns using select for mean and std columns and 
   # include extra last 3 columns for later tidying
X_selected <- cbind(meanCols,stdCols,subject,activity)
X_selected<-tbl_df(X_selected) # cleaned up for screen printing formatting

# -----------------  SECTION STEP 3 ----------------------------

# Changes selected column names to be more descriptive. Most are already 
    # descriptive so only changing some. 

# Gets updated list of column names
X_selected_cols <- colnames(X_selected)

# Column names that start with t are for the variables from time domain signals
    # and start with f are for the fast fourier transformed (FFT) data.  
    # Change column names to better signify this.
X_selected_cols <- gsub("^t","time_", X_selected_cols) # change time columns from t... to time_...
X_selected_cols <- gsub("^f","fft_", X_selected_cols) # change fourier columns from f... to fft_...

# Column names endings are based on dimension, update so consistent with _ separator
     # NOTE: in original column names . is a character, while in gsub regular
     # expression, we adjust for it's use by searching for the character, \\.
     # as otherwise it means "any character". 
     # ...X is for in the x direction vector (based on accelerometer set axes)
     # ...Y is for the y direction vector
     # ...Z is for the z direction vector
     # .. is for a scalar magnitude quantity (sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2))
X_selected_cols <- gsub("\\.\\.\\.X$","_xvector", X_selected_cols)  # update dimension label
X_selected_cols <- gsub("\\.\\.\\.Y$","_yvector", X_selected_cols)  # update dimension label
X_selected_cols <- gsub("\\.\\.\\.Z$","_zvector", X_selected_cols)  # update dimension label
X_selected_cols <- gsub("\\.\\.$","_scalar", X_selected_cols)  # update dimension label

# Structure
# Top level:    Body, Gravity  (Gravity only subsets to Acc)
# Second level: Acc, Gyro, Body 
# Third level:  Jerk, Mag, Gyro
# Fourth level: Mag

# Column names that contain:
     # "Body" within are values applied to the person's body and 
     # "Gravity" are values extracted for system gravitational acceleration. 
     # "Acc" = acceleration
     # "Gyro" = gyroscope value
     # "Jerk" = value for sudden change in acceleration value
     # "Mag" = magnitude (size only, no direction)
     # "mean" = value shown is the mean value of the given type
     # "std" = value shown is the standard deviation of the given type

# -----------------  SECTION STEP 4 ----------------------------

# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

# (Step 4): Replace the new set of column names to X_selected df
X_selected<-setNames(X_selected, X_selected_cols) 

# -----------------  SECTION STEP 5 ----------------------------

# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with 
# the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

funs(mean, "mean", mean(., na.rm = TRUE))

 X_selected <- group_by(X_selected, activity, subject)
 
 X_selected <- arrange(X_selected, activity, subject)
 
 meanData <- summarize_each(X_selected, funs(mean))

 print(meanData)
